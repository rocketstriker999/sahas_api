                        .join("\n\n")
                    }

        ### ALLOWED STREAMS:

        ### CORE ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Carefully interpret student's:
        - Interests
        - Academic strengths/weaknesses (especially Maths & Science)
        - Personality traits
        - Study behavior (hours, pressure tolerance)
        - Career inclination
        2. Do NOT assume missing information.
        3. If something is unclear, treat it as neutral.
